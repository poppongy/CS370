#Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? 
Scenario-- You are working as an AI developer for a gaming company. The company is developing a treasure hunt game where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirates find it. As an AI developer, you have been asked to design an intelligent agent of the game for an NPC (non-player character) to represent the pirate. The pirate will need to navigate the game world, which consists of different pathways and obstacles, in order to find the treasure. The pirate agent’s goal is to find the treasure before the human player. This is commonly called a pathfinding problem, as the agent you create will need to find a path towards its goal. You have been provided with some starter code and a sample environment where your pirate agent will be placed. You will need to create a deep Q-learning algorithm to train your pirate agent. Finally, you have also been asked to write a design defense that demonstrates your understanding of the fundamental AI concepts involved in creating and training your intelligent agent.
In this project, I applied deep Q-learning algorithm for my intelligent agent to reach its goal of reaching the treasure.

  #What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists develop algorithms, analyze data, design software, and solve complex problems through innovative solutions. Their work impacts virtually every industry, from healthcare to finance to entertainment, enhancing efficiency, scalability, and reliability in various applications. By creating technology that powers devices, manages information, and enables communication, computer scientists contribute significantly to modern society. Their work is vital because it drives technological progress and innovation, which ultimately improves quality of life, economic growth, and global connectivity.

# How Do I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?

Computer scientists approach problems methodically, starting with a clear understanding of the issue. They break down problems into manageable parts, identify the requirements, and use a structured process like computational thinking. This involves decomposition (breaking down the problem), pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design. Then, they implement solutions, test for errors, and refine the code. This iterative approach—analysis, design, testing, and refining, enables computer scientists to find efficient, scalable solutions.

# What Are My Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and the Organization?

As a computer scientist, ethical responsibilities include ensuring privacy, security, transparency, and fairness in software design. Protecting user data and maintaining confidentiality is essential to building trust and avoid misuse of information. Computer scientists must also design systems responsibly, avoiding biases in algorithms that could harm individuals or groups. As a computer scientist, I owe it to my organization, to produce accurate and robust code bases to support applications and also develope software that is reliable, maintainable, and aligns with ethical standards. Additionally, it is the ethical responsibility of the scientist to comply with regulations and industry standards, especially in fields where technology impacts safety or well-being.
